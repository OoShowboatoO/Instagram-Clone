# Instagram Clone

The poject is a fully functional Instagram Clone using React, Firebase, and Material-UI, demonstrating my full-stack development skills.\
I developed the front-end with React, styled it using Material-UI and custom CSS to ensure a modern, responsive UI.\
For the backend, I integrated Firebase Firestore for real-time data updates, Firebase Authentication for secure user login, and Firebase Storage for handling image uploads.\
The app allows users to post images with captions, view multiple posts in real-time, and interact through comments.
